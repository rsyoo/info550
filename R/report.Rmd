## Executive summary

These birth records are for the state of Kansas in 1991. We are interested in
examining the associations between the covariates in the data set and adverse
birth outcomes, including low birthweight.

There are `r nrow(birth)` birth records in the data set, with `r ncol(birth)`
variables for each record.

Low birthweight is defined as a weight less than 2500 grams, regardless of gestational age.

Of `r nrow(birth)` births in Kansas in 1991, `r sum(birth$LBW == "1", na.rm = TRUE)` resulted in
low birthweights.

Overall, we found a `r ifelse(cor(birth$BIRTHWEIGHT, birth$AGE_M, use = "complete.obs") > 0, "positive", "negative")`
relationship between maternal age and birthweight.

## Analysis

We analyzed the relationship between maternal age (`AGE_M`) and birthweight (`BIRTHWEIGHT`).
A scatterplot is shown below.
